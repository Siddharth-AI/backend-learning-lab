# 🚀 Node.js Backend Learning Journey (Part 1)

This repository is my **complete Node.js backend learning journey**, covering fundamentals to advanced topics.  
It includes hands-on **projects** and **examples** with different tools, libraries, and patterns to build scalable backends.

Each folder represents a **topic or project** I worked on step by step.

---

## 📂 Current Topics Covered

- **Basic Node.js** → Core modules, file system, events, HTTP server
- **Express.js** → Routing, middleware, request/response cycle
- **EJS** → Template engine for server-side rendering
- **REST API Development** → CRUD, API structure, Postman testing
- **MongoDB Basics** → Connecting, CRUD operations
- **Authentication vs Authorization** → Role-based auth with JWT & bcrypt
- **Bookstore API** → Example project with CRUD & authentication

---

## 🔮 Upcoming Topics (Part 1 Roadmap)

I’ll continue adding more advanced backend concepts here:

- [ ] **Multer** – file uploads
- [ ] **Cloudinary** – image storage & management
- [ ] **Change Password** – secure update with bcrypt
- [ ] **Delete Image Functionality**
- [ ] **Sorting & Pagination** – API responses for large data
- [ ] **Intermediate MongoDB** – aggregation, populate, relations
- [ ] **WebSocket** – real-time communication
- [ ] **Deployment Strategies** – deploying Node.js apps
- [ ] **Node.js with GraphQL**
- [ ] **Node.js with TypeScript**

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Node.js** – runtime environment
- **Express.js** – web framework
- **MongoDB** – database
- **JWT** – authentication tokens
- **bcrypt** – password hashing
- **EJS** – templating engine
- **Multer / Cloudinary** (coming soon)
- **GraphQL / TypeScript** (future)

---

## 🎯 Goal

To build a **solid foundation in backend development** and gradually move from beginner → advanced → full-stack projects.

This repo serves as both:

1. My personal learning log 📝
2. A reference for others learning **Node.js backend development**

---

## 📌 Notes

- This is **Part 1** of my backend journey.
- Future repos may include **advanced Node.js projects** and **full-stack applications**.
